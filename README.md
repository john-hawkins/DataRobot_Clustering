Clustering Predictions
========================

This project demonstrates how you can take a data robot model
and score a new data set to retrieve the prediction explanations
and then cluster those explanations and visualise them.

## Dependencies
 
You will need a DataRobot account and access to a dedicated prediction server.

You will also need a bunch of python libraries, including the DataRobot package

```
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install sklearn
pip install matplotlib
pip install functools
pip install datarobot
```

To run this application you will need a YAML file that authenticates you against your
DataRobot instance when using the DataRobot Python Package. 
Please [follow these guidelines](https://datarobot-public-api-client.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/v2.7.2/setup/configuration.html)
 to set this up


## About

The core functions that retrieve the predictions and their explanations can be found in
the file [drpredexplanations.py](drpredexplanations.py)

The results generated by the above file can then be clustered using one of several functions
found in the file [drclustering.py](drclustering.py)

The above functions are used by the example script and the web application example.

## Caveats

Currently the implementation does k-means on prediction explanation strength only.
Additional algorithms, features and distance metrics will be added.

## Usage

The script [example.py](example.py) shows you how to create clusters by specifying a DataRobot
project model and dataset using an interactive python session.

The file [app.py](app.py) and the contents of the [templates](templates) directory is a python flask 
web application you can use to run the clustering on any of your DataRobot 
projects, provided that you supply a data set to score against.

It will store the plots generated in the folder [static](static) so that they do not need to be re-generated.


To run:

```
python app.py
```

Then follow the prompts
