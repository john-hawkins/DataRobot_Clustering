  <h2>Prediction Explanation Clustering</h2>

<div class="canvas" style="margin: 0 auto; width: 580px;">
  <p>
    Use this application to run clustering over the prediction explanations generated by 
    any model produced by a DataRobot project.
  </p> 
  <p>
    Once generated, the results will be saved in the folder <b>/static</b>
    and reused if you request them again. The file name will be as follows:
  </p>
  <pre>
   PRJECT_ID-MODEL_ID-<METHOD>-<CLUSTER_PARAMETERS>.png
  </pre>
  <p>
    If you want to regenerate te results for the same model
    with an alternative dataset you will need to delete the old version.
